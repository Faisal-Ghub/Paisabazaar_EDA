Collaborators: Faisal Khan & Harish Jaisawal


🔍 Project Overview

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Paisabazaar dataset to uncover insights about consumer credit behavior. The analysis explores patterns in credit scores, income, loan types, age groups, and other financial variables to aid data-driven decision-making in the fintech space.


🎯 Objectives

Analyze distribution and trends of key financial metrics.

Identify correlations and risk factors in consumer credit behavior.

Derive actionable insights to support business strategies and risk management.
